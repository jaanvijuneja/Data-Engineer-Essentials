# Introduction

## Data Engineer

Data Engineers manage transactional data and dimensional models. They assist organizations in migrating their data from on-premise data warehouses to cloud data warehouses, as well as between different cloud data warehouses.

Data Engineers develop data pipelines to ensure a smooth flow of data between the source and destination.

<b>For instance</b>, an organization has traditional data in their on-premise data warehouse and wants to store it in a cloud data warehouse. The Data Engineer will oversee the process of migrating this traditional data from the on-premise data warehouse to the cloud data warehouse.

The Data Engineer will clean, transform, or retransform the data to ensure its compatibility with the cloud environment.

The Data Engineer will develop the data pipelines for a smooth transition and will deploy ETL processes to securely transfer data.
